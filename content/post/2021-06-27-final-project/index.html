<h2>Description of Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project is the Daily Weather in the U.S., 2017. The data is collected by 1589 stations throughout the United States and Canada. The collected data consists of 15 variables; however, only 8 variables were used for this project.</p>

<div id="how-does-the-temperature-change-with-latitude" class="section level2">
<h2>How does the temperature change with latitude?</h2>
<p>It is common sense to expect the temperature to decrease moving farther from the equator. The assumption is that there is an inverse relationship between latitude and temperature. As the latitude increases, the temperature will decrease.</p>
<div id="maximum-temperature-and-latitude" class="section level3">
<h3>Maximum Temperature and Latitude</h3>
<p>The change in the maximum observed temperature related to the latitude fits the following model, where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is 44.79679 and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is -0.30451. Statistically, both values are significant to a level of confidence greater than 99.99%.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_{i}\]</span>
In this case, the maximum temperature decreases at a rate of 0.30451 for every increase in degree of latitude.</p>

</div>
<div id="average-temperature-and-latitude" class="section level3">
<h3>Average Temperature and Latitude</h3>
<p>Since we know the maximum temperature decreases with an increase in latitude, we assume the average temperature also decreases with an increase in latitude. In the chart below, the average temperature does not appear to change with a change in latitude.</p>
<p>The change in the average observed temperature related to the latitude fits the following model, where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is 20.81364083 and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is -0.00041804, basically zero. Statistically, both values are significant to a level of confidence of 90%.</p>
<p>For this chart, the data should be analyzed for any outliers that may be affecting the results.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_{i}\]</span>
In this case, the average temperature does not really change with a change in degree of latitude.</p>
