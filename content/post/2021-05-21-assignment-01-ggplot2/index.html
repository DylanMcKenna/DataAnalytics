<h1>This assignment was completed using the data set: mlb_players_18</h1>
<p>This data contains the offensive statistics of Major League Baseball (MLB) players during the 2018 season.</p>
<div id="this-section-contain-the-categorical-data." class="section level2">
<h2>This section contain the categorical data.</h2>
<p>Show number of homeruns by team and by position.</p>

<p>Show number of homeruns by position.</p>

<h2>This section contains the numerical data.</h2>
<p>The following charts present data for all position players and designated hitters that had 150 or more at-bats.</p>
<p>A player that had at least 150 at-bats would have played in enough games to get consistent playing time.</p>
<p>Home runs have an important impact on a game. Although, some players that swing for home runs can run a risk of striking out more frequently.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create subset of position players and designated hitters with more than 150 at-bats

pos_players &lt;- subset(mlb_stats, !position %in% c(&quot;P&quot;) &amp; AB &gt;= 150)

# Create Plot of Homerun vs Strike out

ggplot(pos_players, aes(x = strike_outs, y = HR)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    x = &quot;Strikeouts&quot;,
    y = &quot;Home Runs&quot;,
    title = &quot;Risk and Reward of Swinging Big&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>

<p>Some players’ strategy is to see more pitches. By seeing more pitches, the batter has an increased opportunity to earn a walk with the risk of striking out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create Plot of Walks vs Strike out

ggplot(pos_players, aes(x = strike_outs, y = walks)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    x = &quot;Strikeouts&quot;,
    y = &quot;Walks&quot;,
    title = &quot;Risk and Reward of Seeing More Pitches&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Do more hits increase the potential for RBI’s?</p>
<p>Looking at the following chart, it appears that the more hits a player earns, the more RBI’s a player earns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Show hits related to RBIs

ggplot(pos_players, aes(x = H, y = RBI)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
    labs(
    x = &quot;Hits&quot;,
    y = &quot;RBI&quot;,
    title = &quot;Drive In Those Runs&quot;) + 
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Another area to explore is the impact of stealing bases on scoring more runs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Show Runs related to Stolen Bases

ggplot(pos_players, aes(x = stolen_bases, y = R)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
    labs(
    x = &quot;Stolen Bases&quot;,
    y = &quot;Runs&quot;,
    title = &quot;Risk and Reward of Stealing Bases&quot;) + 
  theme_classic()</code></pre>

<p>An issue that I have found creating this blog is figuring out why sometimes the information uploads to netlify and sometimes it does not.</p>
<p>I find it interesting how we can present data with so few inputs.</p>
