#  This assignment was completed using the data set: mlb_players_18

This data contains the offensive statistics of Major League Baseball (MLB) players during the 2018 season.


```{r error=FALSE, include=FALSE}

data("mlb_players_18")
head(mlb_players_18)
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
str(mlb_players_18)
mlb_stats <- mlb_players_18
```


## Show number of homeruns by team and by position.


```{r}
# Show the homeruns per team


ggplot(mlb_stats, aes(y = team, x = HR)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    x = "Home Runs",
    y = "MLB Team",
    title = "Home Runs by Each Team"
  )
  theme_classic()
         
```



```{r}
# Show the homeruns per position


ggplot(mlb_stats, aes(y = position, x = HR)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    x = "Home Runs",
    y = "Position",
    title = "Home Runs by Each Position"
  )
  theme_classic()
```

## GREATER THAN 200 ABs: Show homeruns vs strike outs, strike outs vs walks, at-bats vs


```{r}
# Create subset of position players and designated hitters with more than 150 at-bats

pos_players <- subset(mlb_stats, !position %in% c("P") & AB >= 150)

```
